              Welcome! I'm a versatile professional with diverse experiences
              spanning digital content creation, live streaming on Twitch, and
              even venturing into the beauty industry with my own makeup brand.
              Recently, I've embarked on an exciting journey into software
              engineering. My fascination with the inner workings of our digital
              world sparked my interest in tech. Inspired by the talent in the
              industry, I dove into software development through a rigorous
              coding bootcamp. This journey has not only broadened my skill set
              but also fueled my passion for continuous learning and growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll often find me exploring virtual realms
              in PC games. Whether it's the thrill of FPS games or the
              tranquility of simulation games, I'm always on the lookout for my
              next gaming adventure. Currently, Overwatch 2 and Palworld are at
              the top of my list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond gaming, I have a deep appreciation for culinary exploration
              and fashion, drawing inspiration from the world around me. Looking
              ahead, I envision embracing the dynamic lifestyle of New York
              City, with its vibrant energy and endless opportunities.
